<#
    Script to check the status of defined BIOS settings on Lenovo (2017+) devices, by querying WMI.
    Script will check for entries in the $settinPrefixes variable. Different models/aged devices, typically call them slightly different things!
    Script will then check that the Current Status contains "Enabl" as some report Enable, or Enabled. Due to, as above!

    Can be used as a Remediation within Intune for Detection, or Remediation purposes.
